# Silicon-Rush-22
We Team DoctypeHTML plan to build a simple yet powerful Anti-Phising URL Checker Web Extension
which will read the URL of the suspisious website and check it against many parameters.
Based on the analysis, the checker will grade the URL and warn the user accordingly.

The parameters include:
1. Digit Count of the URL
2. Total length of the URL
3. Checking Typosquatting
4. Checking the presence of a legitimate brand name
5. Number of subdomains in the URL
6. Is it Top Level Domain (TLD) or not
7. Checking additional characters which can hide the suspisious part of the URL

Our main objective is to implement this checker into an website extension.
